# Researcher & Builder

I'm currently pursuing my doctorate in Computer Science at the [University of California, Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu/), where I have the privilege of being advised by Professors [Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury](https://vcg.ece.ucr.edu/amit) and [Christian R. Shelton](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~cshelton/).

My research focuses on visual understanding and reasoning, leveraging large language models to bridge low-level perception with high-level semantic inference. I study how structured representations of visual data can enable language-driven reasoning over complex, temporally rich environments, with an emphasis on grounding, abstraction, and generalization beyond static recognition.

Outside of research, I enjoy spending time with my two cats, experimenting with neo-deconstructivist fashion design, and staying active as a NASM-certified personal trainer.
