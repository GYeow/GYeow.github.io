Iâ€™m a first-year CS Ph.D. student at University of California, Riverside, where I have the privilege of working with the amazing [Prof. Christian R. Shelton](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~cshelton/) and [Prof. Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury](https://vcg.ece.ucr.edu/amit).

My research focuses on the captivating realm of vision-language models and dynamic networks, with recent work proposing an efficient transformer encoder design for Mask2Former-style models. This innovative approach optimally selects subnetworks based on the input images. Moreover, it extends beyond segmentation to detection tasks and can be tailored to various computational budgets.

When I'm not immersed in academia, I enjoy spending time with my two beloved cats, pursuing my passion for deconstructivism fashion design, and sharing my knowledge as a NASM certified personal trainer.
