Iâ€™m a first-year CS Ph.D. student at University of California, Riverside, where I have the privilege of working with the amazing [Prof. Christian R. Shelton](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~cshelton/) and [Prof. Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury](https://vcg.ece.ucr.edu/amit).

My research focuses on the captivating realm of vision-language models and dynamic networks, with recent work involving the introduction of an efficient encoder design for Mask2Former-style models. This innovative approach provides a strategy to self-select the number of hidden layers in the encoder, conditioned on the input image. Moreover, it extends beyond segmentation to detection tasks and can be tailored to various computational budgets.

When I'm not immersed in academia, I enjoy spending time with my two beloved cats, pursuing my passion for deconstructivism fashion design, and sharing my knowledge as a NASM certified personal trainer.
